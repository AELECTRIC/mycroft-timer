## Timer
Set timers for cooking, watering plants and more!

## Description 
Use Mycroft when your hands are messy or you need more that the one timer
in your kitchen.  Multiple timers are easy to set and track with
conversational interactions.

On a Mark 1 you'll see visual feedback as the timer runs, and you can use
the top button to stop the beeping once a timer expires.

## Examples 
* "Start a timer for 30 seconds"
* "Set a timer for 1 minutes"
* "Set a timer for 3 hours"
* "Cancel the timer"
* "How long is left on the timer?"
* "Mute the timer" (once triggered)
